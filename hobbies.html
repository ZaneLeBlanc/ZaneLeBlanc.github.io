      <h2>Skateboarding</h2>
      
      <p>When I first moved away for college, I had a high interest in learning
        how to skateboard after seeing many beginner trick tutorals. After giving
         it a try myself I was immediately hooked. I practiced in the hot sun for hours
          and met many fellow skaters just skating around college campus and visiting skateparks
           occasionally.
              Some of my favorite tricks include Kickflip,
              Late shuv, and Rock+Roll</p>

    <h2>Piano</h2>
    <p>I can't remember what got me interested, but Junior year of high
       school I asked for a keyboard for Christmas and began learning some
        of my favorite songs. I have a very basic understanding of music theory
         and reading sheet music Most of the time just teach myself pieces
          I enjoy from Youtube tutorials and by ear. Some of my favorite pieces include
        Gary's Song, i Giorni, and River Flows in You</p>

    <h2>Video Games</h2>
    <p>Video games have been an incredible outlet for me throughout my whole
       life. I love playing online multiplayer games with friends, as well as
        playing single player adventures and challenges. My favorite online
         game to play with friends right now is Valorant as well as Minecraft
          Bedwars. Some of my favorite single player adventures include
           Portal 2, Shovel Knight, Cuphead, and Doom.</p>

    <h2>Reading</h2>
    <p>Reading is something I deeply
       love. I can be picky when it comes to fiction, but when it comes to learning about something new
       I'm very easy to entertain. I'm especially a big sucker for memoirs and self-help books. My favorite books
            include, Perks of Being a Wallflower, Arc of a Scythe, and
            Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck.

    <h2>Cooking</h2>
    <p>While living on my own and having to feed myself for 3 meals a day,
       I've gotten very interested budget meals.
        I got recommended a video one day titled, "Extreme
         budget 63 meals for $20 challenge" and after seeing the recipes in that
          I've been hooked on cooking affordable, easy to prepare, yummy meals
           to keep myself going in a way where I can save money for other
            things in life. As of now I have a full spreadsheet of all of the
             meals I've cooked to organize ingredients and see what I want to
              make in the future.</p>
