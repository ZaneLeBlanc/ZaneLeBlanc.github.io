      <h2>Scamless</h2>
      
      <p>At the HackAI 2021 Hackathon, I worked with a team to create a web app
           that detects whether a message is a scam or not. It uses artificial
            intelligence trained on a database of real and scam messages and classifys any chunk of 
            text as a scam or not. It worked with a combination of Anvil, Python, and the OpenAI API.

    <h2>Titanfall 2 item tracker</h2>
    <p>During the Spring Break of my last year of High School, I realized a need to assist the setup of 10 man 
        competitive Titanfall 2 matches. I created a program that takes quick
        keyword inputs and updates a display on what is still available for choosing. There is also an undo feature for
        when people change their mind.

    <h2>Sleep time tracker</h2>
    <p>I learned from a Youtube Video that it was very beneficial to plan out sleep in 90 minutes cycles, but when
        I looked for a website to figure out when I should go to sleep or wake up I found nothing. Thus, I created my own
        Java program to help calculate the times for myself. I used Java because that was the most recent language I was
        studying in school.

    <h2>Personal Website</h2>
    <p>I wanted to make my own website in order to properly learn HTML and CSS. I needed something fun to get myself motivated
        to learn this new skill instead of playing video games over the Summer so I made this! I took a free course from
        InternetingIsHard.com and created this website as a result.
